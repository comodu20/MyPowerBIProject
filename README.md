üìä My Interactive Power BI Dashboard Portfolio
Welcome to my interactive Power BI Dashboard Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my data visualization projects, allowing you to explore live, interactive dashboards directly in your browser.

About This Portfolio
This portfolio is hosted using GitHub Pages, providing a seamless web experience. Each dashboard is embedded into its own HTML page, and a central navigation system allows you to effortlessly switch between different projects. The goal is to offer a dynamic and user-friendly way to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualisation, and storytelling with Power BI.
